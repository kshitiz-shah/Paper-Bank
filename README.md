# Paper-Bank
# File Management Web Application

This project is a web application that allows users to upload files along with metadata, view uploaded files, and manage (delete) them. It uses Express.js for the server, MongoDB for the database, Multer for handling file uploads, and React for the frontend. The application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the file management system.

## Features

- **Upload Files**: Users can upload files with associated metadata (subject, college, year, and course).
- **View Files**: Users can view uploaded files with filtering options based on subject and year.
- **Delete Files**: Users can delete files from the server, which also removes their entries from the database.
- **Static File Serving**: Uploaded files are served statically.

## Technologies Used

- *Node.js*: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- *Express.js*: Web framework for handling routing and middleware.
- *MongoDB*: NoSQL database for storing file metadata.
- *Multer*: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for file uploads.
- *React*: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- *HTML/CSS*: Used alongside React for styling and layout.
